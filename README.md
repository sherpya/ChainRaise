# ChainRaise: Crowdfunding campaigns on blockchain

Smart contract for crowdfunding campaigns management.
The contract allows users to create, fund and manage crowdfunding campaigns.
Once a campaign is created, backers can contribute funds and receive rewards,
while the campaign creator can manage and update the campaign status.
The contract also includes a refund function, allowing backers to get
their funds back if the campaign does not meet its funding goal (TODO).

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```
